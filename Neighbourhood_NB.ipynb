    "Toronto is an international centre for business and finance. Generally considered the financial capital of Canada. The city is an important centre for the media, publishing, telecommunication, information technology and film production industries; Although much of the region's manufacturing activities take place outside the city limits, Toronto continues to be a wholesale and distribution point for the industrial sector. The city's strategic position along the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor and its road and rail connections help support the nearby production of motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, machinery, chemicals and paper. The completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959 gave ships access to the Great Lakes from the Atlantic Ocean.\n",

    "There has recently been a substantial amount of interest in the emergence of video game development as an industry in Canada and its impact on the economy, the creative industries, the role studios play in specific city ecosystems and how video games affect physically and mentally. A recent study was done at McMaster University studying how playing video games improves the eyesight of those who suffer from vision problems.Toronto, Montreal, Quebec is a particularly popular subject of study due to the maturity of the gaming industry and its overall urban ecology.\n",

    "Therefore, finding space for enough people to work with and/or start on the industry requres a selection of places where to share and build a network. As finding new places might be overwhelming, I decided to move to a office / coworking place locator in order to get to the right place."
